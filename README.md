# Natural Language Processing for Multi-Text Classification

This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning models for multi-class text
classification of Urdu news articles from renowned Pakistani media organizations such as ARY
Geo, Jang, Express and Dunya News. After scraping 1500 articles from the websites of these
media outlets, models such as Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Neural Networks, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest were evaluated for their ability to classify Urdu content into
distinct categories.

# Accuracies:
MNB: 96.3% on internal test data and 96% on third-party test data.

Neural Networks: 95.6% on internal test data.

Logistic Regression: 94.6% on internal test data.

Random Forest: 84.2% on internal test data.
