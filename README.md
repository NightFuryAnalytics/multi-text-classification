# Natural Language Processing for Multi-Text Classification

## Overview
This study investigates the effectiveness of various machine learning models for multi-class text
classification of Urdu news articles from renowned Pakistani media organizations such as ARY,
Geo, Jang, Express and Dunya News. 

## Machine Learning Models
After scraping 1500 articles from the websites of these
media outlets, models such as **Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), Neural Networks, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest** were evaluated for their ability to classify Urdu content into
distinct categories.

## Accuracies
MNB: **96.3%** on internal test data and **98%** on third-party test data.

Neural Networks: **95.6%** on internal test data.

Logistic Regression: **94.6%** on internal test data.

Random Forest: **84.2%** on internal test data.
